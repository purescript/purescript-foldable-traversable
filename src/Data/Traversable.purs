-- | `Traversable` represents data structures which can be _traversed_,
-- | accumulating results and effects in some `Applicative` functor.
-- |
-- | - `traverse` runs an action for every element in a data structure,
-- |   and accumulates the results.
-- | - `sequence` runs the actions _contained_ in a data structure,
-- |   and accumulates the results.
-- |
-- | The `traverse` and `sequence` functions should be compatible in the
-- | following sense:
-- |
-- | - `traverse f xs = sequence (f <$> xs)`
-- | - `sequence = traverse id` 
-- | 
-- | `Traversable` instances should also be compatible with the corresponding
-- | `Foldable` instances, in the following sense:
-- |
-- | - `foldMap f = runConst <<< traverse (Const <<< f)`
